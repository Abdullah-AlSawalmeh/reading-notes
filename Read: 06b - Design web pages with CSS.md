# Introducing CSS3

* CSS treats each HTML e XX lement as if it appears inside its own box and uses rules to indicate how that element should look.
* XX Rules are made up of selectors (that specify the elements the rule applies to) and declarations (that indicate what these elements should look like).
* XX Different types of selectors allow you to target your rules at different elements.
* XX Declarations are made up of two parts: the properties of the element that you want to change, and the values of those properties.
* For example, the font-family property sets the choice of font, and the value arial specifies Arial as the preferred typeface.
* XX CSS rules usually appear in a separate document, although they may appear within an HTML page.

# Colors in CSS3

* Color not only brings your s XX ite to life, but also helps convey the mood and evokes reactions.
* XX There are three ways to specify colors in CSS: RGB values, hex codes, and color names.
* XX Color pickers can help you find the color you want.
* XX It is important to ensure that there is enough contrast between any text and the background color (otherwise
people will not be able to read your content).
* XX CSS3 has introduced an extra value for RGB colors to indicate opacity. It is known as RGBA.
* XX CSS3 also allows you to specify colors as HSL values, with an optional opacity value. It is known as HSLA.
