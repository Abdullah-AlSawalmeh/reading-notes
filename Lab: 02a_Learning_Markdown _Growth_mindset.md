# Growth vs Fixed mindset

## Growth mindset

People who have a growth mindset believe that they can get smarter, more intelligent, and more talented through putting in time and effort. 

## Fixed mindset

A fixed mindset is one that assumes abilities and understanding are relatively fixed. Those with a fixed mindset may not believe that intelligence can be enhanced, or that you either “have it or you don’t” when it comes to abilities and talents.

### The difference between Growth and Fixed mindset

The main difference between the two mindsets is the belief in the permanence of intelligence and ability; one views it as very permanent, with little to no room for change in either direction, while the other views it as more changeable, with opportunities for improvement (or, for that matter, regression).
