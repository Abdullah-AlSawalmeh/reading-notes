## Growth mindset

People who have a growth mindset believe that they can get smarter, more intelligent, and more talented through putting in time and effort. 

## Fixed mindset

A fixed mindset is one that assumes abilities and understanding are relatively fixed. Those with a fixed mindset may not believe that intelligence can be enhanced, or that you either “have it or you don’t” when it comes to abilities and talents.

### The difference between Growth and Fixed mindset

The main difference between the two mindsets is the belief in the permanence of intelligence and ability; one views it as very permanent, with little to no room for change in either direction, while the other views it as more changeable, with opportunities for improvement (or, for that matter, regression).

### Here is another defintion of the growth and fixed mindset from [mindhealth](https://www.mindsethealth.com/matter/growth-vs-fixed-mindset#:~:text=A%20growth%20mindset%20means%20that,never%20be%20good%20at%20it.) website:

>A growth mindset means that you believe your intelligence and talents can be developed over time. A fixed mindset means that you believe intelligence is fixed—so if you're not good at something, you might believe you'll never be good at it.


So, I need to stay all along having the growth mindset, and here are some reminders that I keep remind myself to stay on the growth mindset: 

1. If I felt that I am going to give up on my dream, I keep remoinding myself of how I get to this point, what achievements I have done during my life.
2. If I felt that achiveing the goal that I am working on is too hard, I keep reminding myself that another person in this world have this goal, so surly I can do it.
3. If I felt that I am not good at doing what I am doing, I keep reminding myself that this is easy and I am as a human being, I can do whatever I want.
