# HTML lists 

* There are three t XX ypes of HTML lists: ordered, unordered, and definition.
* Ordered lists use numbers.
* Unordered lists use bullets.
* Definition lists are used to define terminology.
* Lists can be nested inside one another.

# Boxes 

* CSS treats each HTML element as if it has its own box.
* You can use CSS to control the dimensions of a box.
* You can also control the borders, margin and padding for each box with CSS.
* It is possible to hide elements using the display and visibility properties.
* Block-level boxes can be made into inline boxes, and inline boxes made into block-level boxes.
* Legibility can be improved by controlling the width of boxes containing text and the leading.
* CSS3 has introduced the ability to create image borders and rounded borders.


# Comparison and logical operators

You may be familiar with comparison operators from math class. Let’s make sure there aren’t any gaps in your knowledge.
## Comparison Operators
* Less than (<) — returns true if the value on the left is less than the value on the right, otherwise it returns false.
* Greater than (>) — returns true if the value on the left is greater than the value on the right, otherwise it returns false.
* Less than or equal to (<=) — returns true if the value on the left is less than or equal to the value on the right, otherwise it returns false.
* Greater than or equal to (>=) — returns true if the value on the left is greater than or equal to the value on the right, otherwise it returns false.
* Equal to (===) — returns true if the value on the left is equal to the value on the right, otherwise it returns false.
* Not equal to (!==) — returns true if the value on the left is not equal to the value on the right, otherwise it returns false.

## Logical Operators
Comparison operators allow us to assert the equality of a statement with JavaScript. For example, we can assert whether two values or expressions are equal with ===, or, whether one value is greater than another with >.

There are scenarios, however, in which we must assert whether multiple values or expressions are true. In JavaScript, we can use logical operators to make these assertions.

&& (and) — This operator will be truthy (act like true) if and only if the expressions on both sides of it are true.
|| (or) — This operator will be truthy if the expression on either side of it is true. Otherwise, it will be falsy (act like false).


# While loop 

The while loop loops through a block of code as long as a specified condition is true.

```
while (condition) {
  // code block to be executed
}
```

# For loop 


The for loop has the following syntax:

```
for (statement 1; statement 2; statement 3) {
  // code block to be executed
}
```
