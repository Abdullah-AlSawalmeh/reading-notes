# HTML

* HTML pages are text documents. 
* XX HTML uses tags (characters that sit inside angled brackets) to give the information they surround special meaning.
* XX Tags are often referred to as elements.
* XX Tags usually come in pairs.
* The opening tag denotes the start of a piece of content; the closing tag denotes the end.
* XX Opening tags can carry attributes, which tell us more about the content of that element.
* XX Attributes require a name and a value.
* XX To learn HTML you need to know what tags are available for you to use, what they do, and where they can go.

# Extra Markup

* DOCTYPES tell browsers which version of HTML you are using.
* XX You can add comments to your code between the <!-- and --> markers.
* XX The id and class attributes allow you to identify particular elements.
* XX The <div> and <span> elements allow you to group block-level and inline elements together.
* XX <iframes> cut windows into your web pages through which other pages can be displayed.
* XX The <meta> tag allows you to supply all kinds of information about your web page.
* XX Escape characters are used to include special characters in your pages such as <, >, and Â©.

# HTML 5 Layout:

* The new HTML5 elements indicate the purpose of different parts of a web page and help to describe its structure.
* XX The new elements provide clearer code (compared with using multiple <div> elements).
* XX Older browsers that do not understand HTML5 elements need to be told which elements are block-level elements.
* XX To make HTML5 elements work in Internet Explorer 8 (and older versions of IE), extra JavaScript is needed, which is available free from Google.


# Some advices for building a succesful website:

* It's important to understand who your target audience is, why they would come to your site, what information they want to find and when they are likely to return.
* Site maps allow you to plan the structure of a site. 
* Wireframes allow you to organize the information that will need to go on each page. 
* Design is about communication. Visual hierarchy helps visitors understand what you are trying to tell them. 
* You can differentiate between pieces of information using size, color, and style. 
* You can use grouping and similarity to help simplify the information you present.
