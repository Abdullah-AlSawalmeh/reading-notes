# HTML linkd 

* Links are created using the <a> element.
* The <a> element uses the href attribute to indicate the page you are linking to.
* If you are linking to a page within your own site, it is best to use relative links rather than qualified URLs.
* You can create links to open email programs with an email address in the "to" field.
* You can use the id attribute to target elements within a page that can be linked to.

# HTML layout 

* <div> elements are often used as containing elements to group together sections of a page.
* Browsers display pages in normal flow unless you specify relative, absolute, or fixed positioning.
* The float property moves content to the left or right of the page and can be used to create multi-column layouts. (Floated items require a defined width.)
* Pages can be fixed width or liquid (stretchy) layouts.
* Designers keep pages within 960-1000 pixels wide, and indicate what the site is about within the top 600 pixels (to demonstrate its relevance without scrolling).
* Grids help create professional and flexible designs.
* CSS Frameworks provide rules for common tasks.
* You can include multiple CSS files in one page.  


# JavaScript fucntion 

JavaScript provides functions similar to most of the scripting and programming languages.

In JavaScript, a function allows you to define a block of code, give it a name and then execute it as many times as you want.

A JavaScript function can be defined using function keyword.

```
//defining a function
function <function-name>()
{
    // code to be executed
};

//calling a function
<function-name>();
```

The following example shows how to define and call a function in JavaScript.

```
function ShowMessage() {
    alert("Hello World!");
}

ShowMessage();
```
