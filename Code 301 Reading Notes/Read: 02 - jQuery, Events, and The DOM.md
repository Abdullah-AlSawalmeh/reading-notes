In order to use jQuery, the first thing you need to do is include the jQuery script in your page.
You can includ it before the closing </body> tag.

Once jQuery has been added to the page, a second JavaScript file is included that uses jQuery selectors and methods to update the content of the HTML page.

The JavaScript file uses the $() shortcut for the jQuery() function.

**Rather than learn a new way to select elements, jQuery uses a language that is already familiar to front-end web developers: CSS selectors. They:**
• Are much faster at selecting elements
• Can be a lot more accurate about which elements
to select
• Often require a lot less code than older DOM
methods
• Are already used by most front-end developers

**jQuery has methods that offer web developers simpler ways to perform common tasks, such as:**
• loop through elements
• Add I remove elements from the DOM tree
• Handle events
• Fade elements into I out of view
• Handle Ajax requests
