*** I just want to mention that I am following the growth mindset lifestyle, here a small defintion of it***
> People who have a growth mindset believe that they can get smarter, more intelligent, and more talented through putting in time and effort. 

I need to stay all along having the growth mindset, and here are some reminders that I keep remind myself to stay on the growth mindset: 

1. If I felt that I am going to give up on my dream, I keep remoinding myself of how I arrived to this point, what achievements I have done during my life.
2. If I felt that achiveing the goal that I am working on is too hard, I keep reminding myself that another person in this world have done this goal, so surly I can do it.
3. If I felt that I am not good at doing what I am doing, I keep reminding myself that this is easy and I am as a human being, I can do whatever I want.
